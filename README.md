# WiFi-Manager-for-OpenWRT
This is a script and lua accompaniment for openWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05. This script will automatically switch between known APs on a list in order to keep a client connection to the internet. This project is a modified re-release of a defunct (read: non-functioning) script for an older version of openWRT.
